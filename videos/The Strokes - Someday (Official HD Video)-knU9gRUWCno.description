Lyrics:
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling, your head's not right
Ah, see, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time
