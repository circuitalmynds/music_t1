From my KWKC Abilene,Texas years. Tim Taylor aka Tim Holiday  and I shared a house in Abilene for a short time when I was Program Director there."Feed The Fish" was the flipside of "Champagne Lady" which made number 1 for while in Abilene. A very graphical way to describe jumping into the deep...deep river to commit suicide. Isn't traditional country music great??
I understand Tim passed away a few years ago. To my knowledge he never had what is considered a successful recording career.
